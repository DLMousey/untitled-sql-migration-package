# Untitled Semi-Agnostic SQL Migration Package

A centralised migration tool that can be used to manage SQL migrations for a project without installing additional
dependencies into the project itself.

Inspired by the many projects i've worked on that don't use a migrations package and cause chaos every time the database
schema changes.

Yes, i'm aware my directory structure and over-use of files is probably terrible, i'm not that familiar with go.
